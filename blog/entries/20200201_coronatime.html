<title>It's China flu time</title>
<h1>It's <span class="strikethrough">coronatime</span> China flu time</h1>

<p>
    Some of my thoughts and predictions on this current pandemic; COVID-19. This is much more serious than people are taking it for, I will continually update this page with updates. Look for strong text with a date, or strike-through for corrections.
</p>
<p>
    Will now call this virus the China virus, or China flu, as it represents it's geographic origin; and to remain consistent with the naming of pandemics over history <em>ie.</em> <em>Spanish flu</em>. Of course I am aware that <em>Spanish flu</em> did not originate in Spain. But if we're not changing that one's name then China flu will do fine.
</p>
<p>
    Moreover we should seek to place a moral burden of cleanliness on those who may cause harm to other through negligence or by living an unhygienic life.

<h2><strong>20200229</strong>: Public service announcement (PSA)</h2>

<p>
    Friendly reminder to:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Avoid crowded places.
    </li>
    <li>
        Please wash your hand every hour for minimum of 20 seconds.
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not touch your face.
    </li>
    <li>
        When and if you sneeze, sneeze into your elbow.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you see people with symptoms remove yourself from the area, a 1m distance is recommended minimum; more if possible.
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not shake peoples hands.
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoid close contact and sexual relations with unknown persons.
    </li>
    <li>
        Disinfect your workspace and home, phone (especially phone), handles, light switches. 70% ethanol is better for disinfecting; it needs some water for disassociating and solubilising the particles. 
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have elderly or ill family members you may want to consider wearing a mask for their sake, and the health of your co-workers as well.
        Use a filter mask, PM2.5 may work, the mechanism of its spread is still unclear.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    <strong>Some facts on COVID-19 (for context comparisons in parenthesis):</strong>
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Enveloped viral particle (flu: enveloped).
        <ul>
            <li>
                Typically enveloped viral particles are more sensitive to the environment, and cannot survive without a host.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        RNA negative viral replication (flu: RNA positive);
        <ul>
            <li>
                Hopefully this will slow down mutation rate. There is one less step in the reproduction mechanism.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Mortality rate 3/100 for a generalised population sample (flu: 2/1000).
        <ul>
            <li>
                The young and fit are not exempt.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        “R naught,” or R0 for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2014/oct/15/visualised-how-ebola-compares-to-other-infectious-diseases">COVID-19 is 3-5 (flu: 1.2 - 2, ebola: 2, measles: 12 - 18)</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        For a close to real-time tracking of the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak please refer to this link: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">John Hopkins University COVID-19 Map</a>.
        <ul>
            <li>
                There is some delay; currently it is estimated that there are about 200 cases in France, many in the Paris region.
            </li>
            <li>
                Note that contagion seems to follow a non-linear trend (positive); hopefully not exponential. There were about 800 cases in Italy 2 days ago, now there are about 1600.

            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Lastly, I'd like to remind you to relax, eat well, exercise (in isolation if possible), and enjoy your families. With a little personal hygiene this situation should be containable.
</p>

<p>
    Sincerely,
</p>
<p>

<h2><strong>20200229</strong>: Some predictions</h2>
<p>
    Some predictions on what will happen with this pandemic; yes it already is or will be called a pandemic, if you don't see this then you are blind.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Russia will close it's borders to China.
    </li>
    <li>
        A European country will become massively infected.
    </li>
    <li>
        European governments will fail to act, and not be proactive enough in preventing the spread of this disease.
    </li>
    <li>
        The number of cases in Russia will explode; either they are fudging the numbers or are not testing. Currently 4 cases.
    </li>
    <li>
        The number of cases in the USA will explode; either they are fudging the numbers or are not testing. Currently 57 cases.
    </li>
    <li>
        The USA will close it's borders to infected regions eventually.
    </li>
    <li>
        People will start taking this seriously only when the death count exceeds 10,000. It's currently around 3,000; mostly concentrated in China.
    </li>
    <li>
        This thing has an R<sub>0</sub> of about 4-6, going by current estimates, and judging by it's rapid spread; it will infect the whole world. <strong>This thing is gonna light up the John Hopkins map like a mothafucking christmas tree bitch</strong>!
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="strikethrough"><strong>Finally</strong>:</span> The total death count will exceed 100 k, yes that is 100 thousand. I will not come back and change this post, if I am wrong then I was wrong and will admit so. I will at most strike the text and update. This is a soft estimate; the United Nations estimates that there are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/ageing/WorldPopulationAgeing2019-Highlights.pdf">703 M people aged over 65</a>. So if only 100 M (1.3% of the total population) of these become infected that's 3 M dead, I'll lower that estimate to 100 k minimum!!! Note that I am lowering this so drastically because the probability of all of these peoples becoming infected in the set of the total population is not 100%. I would have to do some more complex calculations relative to the R<sub>0</sub> of the virus; will do this later.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Posted - 20200309</strong>: France will likely enter a quarantine; mandatory country wide quarantine. I am currently here in Paris. I hope that finally things will get serious. Things are getting to be rather serious in Italy, currently at 5,883 cases; France at 949. It does not seem like much, but remember this is the danger of an exponential trend. At first there is nothing then it explodes straight up.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Posted - 20200318</strong>: France has entered a quarantine. I am disappointed. Two weeks were announced, 14 days. This is nowhere near what is required in order to combat the spread of the virus. I predict that this will likely be extended. There is no way that it will only be for two weeks; if anything this is to not cause a Panic. I might leave the country, go to a private location. 
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    People are taking this too lightly, this will be bad. Stock markets will fall, the economy will go in the toilet, travel will be impacted, people will die of infection, and starvation etc.

    <strong>20200327</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/26/unemployment-claims-coronavirus-3-million/">A record 3.3 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits as the coronavirus slams economy</a> - <em>The washington post</em>.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Last week saw the biggest jump in new jobless claims in history, surpassing the record of 695,000 set in 1982. Many economists say this is the beginning of a massive spike in unemployment that could result in over 40 million Americans losing their jobs by April.

<h2>Misc</h2>
<p>
    Will work on misc projects to keep my brain occupied during my off time. I don't want any off time; either I'm working between normal work hours (7h - 19h [with a break of course]), or "working" on personal projects. On my list of things to do: learn R in greater depth, learn Docker, study mathematics, create personal plotting library in JS, etc. I might post some results for fun below.
</p>
<p>
    Might eventually move this section into another post if it gets too large.
