<h1>Gene Doping</h1>
    <p>
        Just personal notes on the subject. I've got a presentation to work on. It will cover the following topics: gene doping, detecting gene doping, and circumventing said detection methods.

<h3>Detection of exogenous gene doping of IGF-I by a real-time quantitative PCR assay</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>
        In this study they define gene doping as the following:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        ...the introduction of the functional gene or recombinant protein into the body to enable its expression or to modulate the expression of an existing gene in order to enhance an athlete’s physiological performance...

        Zhang <em>et al.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        The basics of what they did in this study is the following. They Chose insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), they then made a synthetic version which was recombined with adeno-associated virus (rAAV) plasmid, then the whole was injected into the thigh muscle of mice. After a determined amount of time to allow expression they sampled blood and muscle at different points in time which was used to isolate total DNA from the tissues. Whereafter a qPCR was run; a TaqMan probe was used that ran between exon 2 and 3 of the IGF-I gene, this would distinguish the result from the exogenous version; they are testing for the natural version.
    </p>
    <p>
        IGF-I is a polpeptide hormone 70 amino acids long. It can act as an endocrine, autocrine, and paracrine type hormone. It's mainly made in th eliver and muscles, some can be made in the brain. It can increase muscle mass, regulate skeletal muscle growth and regeneration, as well as increase the consumption of fat. Not only can it increase muscle quality but it seems it can even increase muscle strength.
    </p>
<h4>Materials and methods</h4>
    <p>
        Seems that they synthesised IGF-I <em>de nuovo</em>. They got the sequence from GenBank and had it made by Genewiz Inc. They digested the ends of the sequence and the plasmid with Hind III and Nsi I restriction enzymes. Then transformed into Sure 2 cells. 
    </p>
<h4>Data</h4>
    <h5>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)</h5>
        <p>
            Blood was collected from the animals and tested with the following assays: ELISA, qPCR, and statistical analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            They found the following:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>IGF-I gene doped mouse validated by ELISA assay.</dt>
            <dd>
                This allowed to test the amount/concentration of IGF-I in the animal, and thus show that that the model is valid because it's expressing more of the protein after the modification.
            </dd>
            <dt>qPCR repeatability validated by electrophoretic gel</dt>
            <dd>
                This was done to test the specificty of the results. They took the qPCR products and ran them in a gel in order to see if other sequences had been amplified. 
            </dd>
            <dt>Sampling location</dt>
            <dd>
                They found that muscle sampling at 3 to 7 days after infection showed the greatest difference, 14 and 30 day showed no difference.
            </dd>
            <dt>Sampling quantities</dt>
            <dd>
                They found that sampling quanitities did not affect the results.
            </dd>
        </dl>

<h4>Questions and criticisms</h4>
    <p>
        In this study they used a recombined adeno associated virus to infect the animals. Moreover these viruses were injected directly into the muscles of the animals. My question is does this virus go on to infect the whole organism. Moreover is it a transient transformation lasting only as long as the infection? Or is it a permanent modification.
    </p>
    <p>
        It seems to be that the infection/transformation is only transient since they present results showing that detection falls off after about 14 days. I will have to verify this.
    </p>
    <p>
        They claim that detection can be done regardless of sampling location
    </p>


<h2>Detecting gene doping</h2>
    <p>
        Here are some of my ideas on detecting gene doping:
    </p>
<h3>Hammer approach</h3>
    <p>
        Why not do whole genome sequencing of athletes before they even qualify for high-level sports. Then compare their genomes with those right before competitions. This would not only be interesting to prevent gene doping, but it could also offer data into the interplay between the genome and athletic performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course this could be circumvented by making "designer" babies, or modifying the genome of the person well before-hand. Or even applying a genetic modification to only one portion of the athletes body.
