        <p>
            FFS, have to remember this word! STREAK! To streak a Petri dish. It is the process of smearing or spreading bacteria on a Petri dish. Or any other form of life on a dish for growth or testing. Just remember it.

            I've been stuck searching for this word in my head multiple times while in the lab. Remember it is: <strong>STREAK!</strong>
