                            Here are various articles (scientific or not) & books that I've read and found useful. If I am distrubuting a copyrighted work and you would like to see your worked removed from this page, please let me know and I will remove it. I hope these are accessible to all and useful for those in need.

                            When possible and of value, I try to bring some commentary, or notes on the subject to better help understand. In some cases I'll try to summurise and simply present the work in a few lines for quick consumption.
