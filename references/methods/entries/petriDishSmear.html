<title>Petri dish smears</title>
<h1>Petri dish smears</h1>
<p>
    Petri dish smears should follow a specific protocol. This in order to evenly spread the cells over a nutrient rich gel. Depending on what is being done we could be trying to isolate certain strains or just test them against an antibiotic.

    We previously <a href="MET_Petri_Dish_Prep.php">prepared Petri dishes</a>, new let's look at how to put something of interest on said dishes for culture.
</p>
<p>
    For this process you will need the following:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Previously prepared Petri dishes
        </li>
        <li>
            Bunsen burner            
        </li>
        <li>
            Long wooden sticks
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Protocol</h2>
<p>
    Take one of the wooden sticks and sterilise it over the flame of a bunsen burner. Then dip or touch the stick gently to the sample to be smeared.
</p>
<p>
    Place this end gently onto the gel of a petri dish to be used. And slowly smear the stick in a back and forth motion in more or less the same spot. 
</p>
<p>
    Turn the dish about 30&deg; and again smear the stick in this same motion. This time though pass the stick in the previous path only once.
</p>
<p>
    Again take turn the dish and repeat the process until you come full circle back to the previously smeared path.
