<h1>Origins of replication <em>(E. coli)</em></h1>
<p>
    Common origins of replication (ori) used in <em>E. coli</em>. Never put two plasmids with the same origin of replication in the same cell. Check compability; careful that two different oris are not just a few nucleotides different.
</p>
<p>
    If you put two plasmids with the same replication mechanism, they will compete with each other and one will eventually be lost.
